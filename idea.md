Create a prototype that demonstrates the key features of the Resource Mesh concept. Use the attached file as a starter and keep the same layout/functionality.

Here are the main components:

Network Status Monitoring:

Shows current connection status (mesh active vs. internet down)
Displays battery level for device longevity awareness
Maps nearby mesh nodes with signal strength indicators
Identifies relay nodes that extend the network

Resource Coordination:


Tracks both needs and available resources
Shows real-time status (available, in transit, needed)
Priority-based visualization
Location-aware matching
Quantity tracking for supplies

Mesh Network Features:


Peer-to-peer connection management
Signal strength monitoring
Battery level tracking for all nodes
Distance calculations
Network coverage estimation

Key advantages over traditional systems:

Functions without internet infrastructure
Creates self-organizing local networks
Provides real-time resource visibility even during blackouts
Optimizes for battery life and network coverage
Enables direct peer-to-peer resource matching

Would you like me to:

Add more features to demonstrate the offline capabilities

Add emergency broadcast capabilities
keep in mind the following:
* Broadcast creation interface
* Active broadcast monitoring
* Priority-based messaging

Add a resource matching algorithm demonstration
keep in mind the following:
* Priority-based matching system
* Location-based matching
* Emergency request handling

Verify the following functionality to the best of your ability.

Offline scenarios (stores data locally)
